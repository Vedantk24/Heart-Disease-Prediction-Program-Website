# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Program-Website
Heart disease prediction program websites are designed to help individuals assess their risk for developing heart disease. These websites typically ask users to input various demographic and lifestyle information, such as age, gender, smoking status, family history, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and physical activity levels.

Based on this information, the website calculates the individual's risk for developing heart disease and provides personalized recommendations for reducing their risk. These recommendations may include lifestyle changes such as increasing physical activity, eating a heart-healthy diet, quitting smoking, and managing other health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

Some heart disease prediction program websites may also provide educational resources about heart disease, its risk factors, and how to prevent it. It is important to note that these websites are not a substitute for medical advice, and individuals should always consult with their healthcare provider before making any significant lifestyle changes or beginning any new exercise or nutrition program.
